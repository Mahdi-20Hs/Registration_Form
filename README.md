# Registration_Form
This is a Registration form project that I made while going through TOP curriculum, it was a small project and yet I learned a ton of things while building it and I really enjoyed it!

## What I learned:
- Lhe function and the use of many form control elements like ("text, number, radio, checkox, button ...).
- How to create a proper form structure and layout.
- Learned about attributes that help in clint-side validation (required, min, max, minlength, maxlength, pattern).
- How and when to use CSS pseudo classes like (:valid, :invalid, :before, :after, :focus, :not, :placeholder-shown).
- Learned about regular expressions and how to write them.
